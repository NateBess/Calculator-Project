## Summary

I built this as a technical assessment for Andy Sterkowitz's Software Development MasterMind Program.
It is a simple webpage that shows a running digital clock.

This calculator does math in the following order:

<ul>
<li>ALL Multiplication</li>
<li>ALL Division</li>
<li>ALL Addition</li>
<li>ALL Subtraction</li>
</ul>

I also added a random number button, that will enter a random number between 1 and 100.
